I go by Ano, I love building stuff, I love spending time to learn new technologies. I love music as much as I love computers, sometimes maybe a little more.
I am curious towards Economics, Politics, Finance and a little bit of history.

I loved working as a SWE at Amazon Robotics and Susquehanna International Group, where I was just given a problem space and had to come with the solution by myself.
I have also noticed that I thrive in places where I have stronger degree of ownership. Since it allows me to be a part of the whole lifecycle of the product - Prototyping on figma, Building the frontend with react, designing API contracts, writing high performance servers, modelling database, and handling the deployment of the application

Currently Golang is my language of choice, however a big fan Dotnet Core, Typescript and ofcourse Python and experimenting with Rust and Zig

I spent majority of my college participating, mentoring, judging and hosting hackathons and building defunct startups.

Serving as a Teaching Assistant at CCI, Drexel has been one of my most fulfilling experiences.

### Courses I've TA'd:

- CI-101: Intro to Software Development
- CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms
- CS 270: Mathematical Foundations of Computers
- CS 277: Algorithms and Analysis
- CS 481: Computer Networks
- CS 283: Computer Architecture
- CS 380: Artificial Intelligence

Prior to coming to drexel, I founded Max Q India (currently defunct) where I spent my time raising awareness for space education in india. We participated in building cube satellites, model rockets and helping out a few peer startups.
I started the organisation at 15, and led with the motive to give back and learn. Building something that leaves the earth for it's mission has been a life changing experiences.
